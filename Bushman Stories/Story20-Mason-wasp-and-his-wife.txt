THE MASON WASP138 AND HIS WIFE.

The Mason Wasp139 formerly did thus as he walked along, while (his) wife walked behind him, the wife said: "O my husband! Shoot for me that hare!" And the Mason Wasp laid down his quiver; the Mason Wasp said: "Where is the hare? And (his) wife said: The hare lies there."

And the Mason Wasp took out an arrow; the Mason Wasp in this manner went stooping along.140 And the wife said: "Put down (thy) kaross! Why is it that thou art not willing to put down (thy) kaross? " Therefore, the Mason Wasp, walking along, unloosened the strings of the kaross; he put down the kaross. Therefore the wife said: " Canst thou be like this?141 This must have been why thou wert not willing to lay down the kaross."

Therefore, the Mason Wasp walked, turning to one side; he aimed at (his) wife, he shot, hitting the (head of) the arrow on (his) wife’s breast142 (bone).

And (his) wife fell down dead on account of it. Then he exclaimed: "Yi ii hihi! O my wife hi! " (crying) as if he had not been the one to shoot (his) wife. He cried, that he should have done thus, have shot his wife; his wife died.
